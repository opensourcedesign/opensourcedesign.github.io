# What we want to achieve

## 1. Open up the design process
  * find existing projects with open design processes, e.g. Mozilla, Canonical
  * aggregate design blogs of open source projects


## 2. Make designers contributors
  * git workshops
  * provide resources about how to collaborate for designers
  * meetups / events / hackathons for designers who want to contribute to OS
  * work with design students at university
  * think about how to make OS contributions more rewarding and attractive for designers

## 3. Communication between designers and developers
  * easier way to use IRC
  * a job board for designers to find open source projects
  * develop guidelines on how to write documentation, issues, comments that designers (or non-technical contributors in general) can work with
  * create guidelines on how to present a design to a community with reasoning. And how the community can review the design in a constructive way

## 4. Connect the existing open source design community
  * FOSDEM open source design devroom, Libre Graphics Meeting
  * go to conferences of other open source projects: GUADEC, DrupalCon, …
  * approach open source companies in supporting the open source design movement

## 5. Funding for open source design
  * contact foundations who already fund open source projects: NLnet, Knight Foundation, Shuttleworth
  * contact agencies

## 6. Showcase existing open source design material
  * icons, fonts, templates
  * workflows

## 7. Work on improving the design of open source projects
  * UX reviews
  * consulting
  * mockups
