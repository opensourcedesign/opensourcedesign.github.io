[Etherpad](http://etherpad.org/) is a collaborative editor, you probably have used it or use it.  Our front end is in constant need of UI love and polish.  Editors are hard to design for, our web experience extends to mobile and beyond.  While most things are not currently "broken" we're always looking out for ways we can polish and update our UI.  We're also looking to constantly update and refine the etherpad.org landing page to improve the initial visitor experience.  This job will include a lot of creative freedom and ability to express yourself, the only thing I will ask is whoever decides to take it on commits a period of time to support their changes.
