The Metta Center for Nonviolence is looking for a designer who want to help out with a free open source software app project for Android

The app will be called the Daily Metta App, and will present reflections on wisdom teachings and is based on the existing Daily Metta articles:
"Daily Metta is a daily reflection on the strategic and spiritual insights of Mahatma Gandhi (and in the future other wisdom teachers) in thought, word and deed"

You can find an archive of all Daily Mettas here: http://mettacenter.org/daily-metta/

The github page for the Daily Metta app project can be found here: https://github.com/MettaCenter/DailyMettaApp/

We are now looking for a designer who has interest in Android design and text layout.
Any level of involvement is welcome!
