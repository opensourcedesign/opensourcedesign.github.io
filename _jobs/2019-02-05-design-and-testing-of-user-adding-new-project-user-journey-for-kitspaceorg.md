Kitspace is looking for help to improve the user experience for a new user who wants to add a new project to Kitspace.

Kitspace is a website for the electronics projects community. It could be described as a "Thingiverse for electronics" - a registry of open hardware electronics projects. 

It provides you with all the information you need to order and build the project - click on any project to get further info, download the Gerbers and see the bill of materials.
