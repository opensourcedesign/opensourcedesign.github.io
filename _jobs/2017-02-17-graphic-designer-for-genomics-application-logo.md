Labsquare is a community of bioinformatics scientist whose aims to create
opensource genomics tools. It is a great necessity with the arrival of new
technologies of DNA highoutput sequencing.

We released our first application named FastQt . It's a Qt/C++ based application
which process DNA sequence file and generate several plot and statistics.  You
can have the application preview as a gif animation here:

We plan to release the next release 0.2 for this month. FastQt has been already
selected in the Omics tools project:
