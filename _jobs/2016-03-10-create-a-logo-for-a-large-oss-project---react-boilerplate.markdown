react-boilerplate is one of the most popular starter kits for react.js that exists, but still doesn't have a proper logo.  It needs a logo to show "window shoppers" we're committed and are going to maintain it for the foreseeable future.

Ideally it'd be an icon that works on it's own, and then maybe the text "react boilerplate" typeset nicely. Important requirements are that it's recognizable and can scale down well so we can use it as a favicon!
