Hello everyone,

We are Urban Noise, an open-source organization and we want to build a new application to monitor all the noise in the cities allowing end-users to know which places are noisier to live. 

We are a small team of 4 software engineers willing to learn new things about designs, UX and branding.

So far, we were busy building the basics in our tech side, like some standards of coding and defining the architecture to get the data and as well to send the data to the end-user, but now we are missing this important member to achieve an awesome design and a great user experience.
