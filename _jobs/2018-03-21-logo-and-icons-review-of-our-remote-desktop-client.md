title: Logo and icons review of our remote desktop client
role: Logo and application icons design
compensation: paid
deliverables: "A feature rich Remote Desktop Application for Linux and other Unixes.\r\nWe'd like to review our logo, the R that symbolise a Network connection and we'd like a complete redesign of our in app icons (see screen shots). We were thinking a rabbit shaped R to symbolise the speed, the jumping, the tunnel digged by this rabbit named Remmina, that will be our mascot. For the icons we'd like something, or just an extention, similar to feathericons,in vector and all the typical icon sizes till 512 px. We have a tight budget but can offer some good visibility and support. As I was saying an extention of the feathericons is fine."
