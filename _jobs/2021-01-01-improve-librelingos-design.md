Looking for someone who wants to shape the future design on LibreLingo.

Currently, LibreLingo is using an open source Bulma template. We are looking for something more original and ambitious. We need a person who wants to take care of our design. This would involve creating design tokens, a design language and the design of basic components. Some more details: https://github.com/kantord/LibreLingo/issues/754
