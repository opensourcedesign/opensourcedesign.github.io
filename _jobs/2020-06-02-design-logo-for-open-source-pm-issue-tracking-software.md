We'd love a beautiful logo to go with our open source project and platform.

"Pachno" is the name of our new iterated version of "the bug genie", an open source issue tracking and project management platform. We are looking for someone to help us design a logo (without name) for it. The "pachno" name is a word play on "pachnoda": a category of beetle (which happens to be similar to our previous logo designed in 2006) which represents the "bug" - the phrase used for issues in software. Preferred color profile is a bit "toned down" and subtle in or around the color value #0c8990, but we are open for someone with better suggestions.

The extent of involvement is up to you. We are all volunteers.
