Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a US-based NGO and global community of thousands of volunteers working together to use maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. The Scrum Master/Mentor will oversee the scrum and development teams and coach and mentor the HOT tech team as agile/scrum is adopted more broadly across the organisation. You will be an Agile advocate and scrum superstar, which will motivate those around you. The Scrum Master/Mentor will act as a buffer between the scrum teams and module owners and maintain a safe working environment for the team by helping with conflict resolution.

You will need to be able to think fast to help solve problems. Strong communication skills are essential as you will be communicating with the development and scrum teams and the module owners. You will be experienced in managing stakeholders and multiple priorities and are dedicated to delivering win-win solutions.
