Sabayon is a Gentoo-based Open Source Linux Distribution. 

Currently we are looking forward for a complete re-style also from an Operative System perspective. It includes branding of bootsplash, a complete review of UI Graphics for the supported Desktop Environments, wallpapers, website and more.
