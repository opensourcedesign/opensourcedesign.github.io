Hy,
this is my hobby project, a fun little android game.
At the current moment I'm totally unhappy with its design, being it the logo/icon, the user interface of the game and not even its website (githubpage).

I would appreciate any help or ideas for a change in design.
As it being only a fun project I can not pay anything, but I will implement a about part in the app and list everybody who contributed to the project.

Best regards,
FallenRiteMonk
