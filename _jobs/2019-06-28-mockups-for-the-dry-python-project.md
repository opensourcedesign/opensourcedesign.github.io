The dry-python project is a set of libraries for pluggable business logic components.

It is an opensource project running completely by volunteers efforts. We are all backend developers without significant experience in web design. But we want our site to look nice.

The main goal is to engage Python developers to try some libraries from our project by showing source code examples and screenshots of working integrations with the Python ecosystem.

Obviously, our site has main, team, community, news, talks and blog pages.

Our existed logos are stored in this repository: https://github.com/dry-python/brand/tree/master/logo

We want to keep them as is.

The design should contain places with links to our GitHub, Twitter, Gitter, and ReadTheDocs accounts.

That's all I guess.

Best regards,
Artem.
