title: UX/UI design help needed for a new  file sharing project
role: 'Interaction design, User interface design'
compensation: gratis
description: "Arbore is a social file-sharing application. The goal is to provide a way for people to share pictures/documents/whatever with their friends/colleagues/contacts privately and safely. The second goal is to reduce the dependency of people to the silo of data that are Facebook, Google, Dropbox ... that trap them. In short, to provide a viable alternative solution and to help people protect their private life.\r\n\r\nAlternative solution already exists but require technical knowledge and time to setup and maintain. In part because of that, they are not very successful. Arbore is my attempt to change that. I think that such a tool should be as easy to setup and use as VLC.\r\n\r\nThis project is already well underway and close to a working MVP. That said, I need help from people more knowledgeable than me in UX and UI design to make it really slick and beautiful. I'm just a developer after all ! Even if the current state is not terrible, it could be much better. And on a project like this, it's the difference between success or not."
deliverables: "There is a lot of low hanging fruit that you can help me with:\r\n- UX/UI feedback and suggestion\r\n- UX/UI design of the remaining part of the application\r\n- design/marketing for the website\r\n- UX/UI design for the on-boarding process\r\n- probably some other things"
