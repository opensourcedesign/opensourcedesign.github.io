Hello fellow OSS devs :)

I need some UI/UX help with https://twtxt.net/

Couple of things straight up:

- The Margins between article/posts is a big wasteful on larger devices.
- The top navbar should be mobile friendly ala burger menu

That's all I have for now; but open to other suggestions and ideas.

This uses the https://picocss.com/ CSS framework.

You can reach me on FreeNode in #twtxt or private message me (@prologic).
You can also reach out via the Github Project itself: https://github.com/prologic/twtxt/issues

Kind regards

James
