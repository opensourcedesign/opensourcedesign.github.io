InspectorWidget is an opensource suite to track and analyze users behaviors in their applications.
The [Collector](https://github.com/InspectorWidget/InspectorWidgetCollector) tool logs desktop usage: screen video, mouse+keyboard events, a Document Object Model (DOM) of widgets for each application window through accessibility APIs.
The [Iterator](https://github.com/InspectorWidget/InspectorWidgetIterator) tool allows to: browse these recordings; program annotations to track the states and events of widgets, windows, applications, and objects in the scene; and extract metrics for quantitative analysis of workflows.

The InspectorWidget suite is released under the terms of the [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) license.

InspectorWidget is looking for:

- Users and testers: usability experts, user experience and human-computer interaction researchers who undertake contextual inquiries and (quantitative) usability testing, what InspectorWidget aims at assisting.
- UI/UX designers: for improving the user interface of InspectorWidget, and for helping to better communicate the benefits of InspectorWidget through a website, logos, icons.
