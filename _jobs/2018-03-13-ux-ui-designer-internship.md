Zamphyr Internship Program is an opportunity to be a part of a revolutionary startup set out to change technology education as we know it. You will be working on open-source technologies in education, improving our platform and spreading the vision of universal educational change to people and developer communities.

This internship is an unpaid, remote, project-based program, lasting 3 months (up to 6 months if required by accepted interns). Accepted interns work part-time (20 hrs/week) on projects or initiatives with mentors. Internship is remote and we give each intern an important part of the ecosystem through the project. The program is international and a great opportunity to meet new friends from all around the world. We use Slack, Zoom, Gitlab, Trello and Google Docs for the best remote workflow.

During our internship program, interns work only on the open-source part of things. I'm personally against unpaid labor so we don't have interns work on the proprietary part of the platform, and we try to provide value for them by using our HCI/UX expertise while helping them build something that is useful for everyone.

We don't put any firm requirements for interns because we feel like their hobby or past work speaks volumes for them. For this particular position (UX/UI Design Intern), interns will have a chance to go through things like Storyboarding, User Research, mapping of information architecture, A/B tests, Wireframing, accessibility initiatives, localization initiatives, grid systems, design systems and visual design. And example of a previous project for design interns would be: http://open.zamphyr.com
