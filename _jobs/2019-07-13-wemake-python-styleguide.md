We are working on the strictest `python` linter ever.
And we already have a good logo:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wemake-services/wemake-python-styleguide/master/docs/_static/logo.png"
       alt="wemake-python-styleguide logo">
</p>

But, there are some things that I dislike in it:
1. Quality. It is low
2. Details. It does not look finished, more like a sketch

It is also possible to change `L` letter to `WPS` letters.
`L` stands for linter, `WPS` is used as an error code for our warnings and stands for `wemake-python-styleguide`.

I would like to recreate it, saving the original intent, but making it slightly better.
I will provide gratis to the author of a new logo.

Logos that were made for my other projects that I like (just a reference):
