Each year during Akademy we have training sessions that help our open source community grow their skills.

During a recent poll, one of the most requested training topics was "UI/UX design for developers". For that reason, we're looking for a trainer that could conduct a training session on this topic for Akademy 2020 in September.
We're looking for a person that has experience in conducting professional trainings and is qualified in the topic. This year’s Akademy will be completely online, so access to proper equipment for streaming the session is expected.
Familiarity with KDE or open source  is not required but definitely a plus.
