## Brief

Mailchain enables blockchain-based email-like messaging with plain or rich text and attachment capabilities. Using blockchain protocols and decentralized storage, Mailchain delivers a simple, secure, messaging experience.

We're looking for a new logo and color scheme to be used across the Mailchain website and application (Open Source).

It should also take the [Mailchain tenets](https://github.com/mailchain/mailchain-specification/blob/master/mailchain_tenets.md) into account and be simple, clean and modern.

Existing logos can be seen on the Mailchain website (https://mailchain.xyz) ([light](https://mailchain.xyz/images/mailchain/logo-light.png) and [dark](https://mailchain.xyz/images/mailchain/logo-dark.png)), and [twitter](https://twitter.com/Mailchain_xyz).

Colors can be similar to what we have today, or something quite different, but should help make it easy to read and interact with the user interface. The current inbox theme uses barebones bootstrap [theme colors](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/theming/#theme-colors). You can see a video walkthrough of the existing interface [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tgj4RnUGMk).
