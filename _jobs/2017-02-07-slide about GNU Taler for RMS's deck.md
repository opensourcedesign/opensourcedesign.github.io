[GNU Taler](https://taler.net/) is a new electronic payment system, and RMS would like to have 1-3 slides to show while he is talking about it when giving talks.

We have some ideas of what to show/draw, but creative ideas are welcome as well. The key point is to show that the person paying is anonymous, while the person receiving the money is transparent to the government.
