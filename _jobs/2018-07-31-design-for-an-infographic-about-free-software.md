We are looking for a designer who can create an infographic that visualizes the benefits of Free Software licences based on the imput that we gathered with our campaign group.

The result will be used in a brochure that explains the benefits of Free Software to decision makers in public administration and politics. The brochure is part of the campaign "Public Momney, Public Code!". We want legislation requiring that publicly financed software developed for the public sector be made publicly available under a Free and Open Source Software licence.
