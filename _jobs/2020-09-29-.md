The SustainOSS UX & Design working group is starting a podcast that will be called 'SOSDesign' or 'SOS Design' which stands for 'Sustaining Open Source Design' (or Sustainable Open Source Design'. 
We'd like to have a logo designed by the community that works across typical podcast platforms and works in the sizes expected of marketing (Usually square sizes).

Some brand identity would also help us make banners and social posts in the future :)

Does not need to follow or use the sustainoss colours or styles in any way!
