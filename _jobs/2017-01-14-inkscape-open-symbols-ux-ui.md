Inkscape Open Symbols are open source SVG symbol sets that can be used as Inkscape symbols.
The project has grown recently with many contributions
We want to design a website (and branding) to help other users understand the project, install the symbols and how to contribute.

The expected outcome is a wireframe and/or design of the website.
In an open issue, contributors discussed the main points that the website as to contain:

- A list of the offered symbols sets
- A basic how to install them on different platforms
- A screencast of how to use them
- A how to contribute and current contributors.
- Latest release.
- Choose a representative symbol/image for each symbol set.

The list will be update in the project issue: https://github.com/Xaviju/inkscape-open-symbols/issues/57
