The project is an culinary APP, where the users can post and serch culinary
recipes. The differential in this APP is that the user can search recipes by
the ingredients they have at home.  Some like: "What can I cook with
<this things...>".

We already have screen prototypes (are just six screens), but we want someone
who let this beautiful :)

Because it is an open source project we can not afford it. However, if the APP
succeeds and can be monetized, everyone involved in the project will be duly
compensated.

We don't need someone with largue experience, just someone who wants to learn
and increases your portfolio.
