The Document Foundation (TDF), the charitable entity behind the world’s leading free office suite LibreOffice, seeks a

* research in bugzilla, searching for consensus for ux-advice bugs

Main tasks
----------

* mentoring new contributors in the user experience community, to introduce them the existing workflows
* volunteer inclusion: both UX/design, and also developers interested in hacking user interface
* growing the contributor base and doing community outreach
* organizing remote UX meetings (via phone, video conference or IRC) and in-person
* establishing and fostering coordination and communication between developers, the user experience team, marketing and design, acting as a gateway between these

Other tasks
-----------

* conducting surveys to improve the LibreOffice user experience and presenting results to the community
* working on improving existing LibreOffice Glade-based dialogues and drafting/developing new ones
* working with others on concepts, designs, strategies to evolve the LibreOffice user interface, drafting new user interface elements
* prototyping
* identification of EasyHacks to lower the entry barrier to the UX community
* triaging ux-advice bugs in bugzilla

Tasks have to be carried out in joint cooperation with our existing developer, marketing and UX/design community, and with our Development Mentoring Lead.

The role requires the following:
--------------------------------

* experience using LibreOffice
* experience in interacting with the LibreOffice community or another large open source project
* working closely with our volunteer community on tooling, processes and means of collaboration
* a track record in user experience and design
* advantageous: teaching/mentoring

The work time during the day is flexible, apart from some fixed times when availability is required (e.g. during meetings, which usually take place at 1400 or 1500 UTC once per week).

TDF welcomes applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, sex, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation or age.

As always, TDF will give some preference to individuals who have previously shown a commitment to TDF, including but not limited to members of TDF. Not being a member, or never having contributed before, does not exclude any applicants from consideration.

The job is offered on a freelance basis. Work happens from the applicant’s home office, which can be located anywhere in the world.

TDF is looking forward to receiving your applications, including curriculum vitae, your financial expectations, and the earliest date of your availability, via e-mail to Florian Effenberger at floeff@documentfoundation.org **no later than January 8, 2016.** You can encrypt your message via PGP/GnuPG.

If you haven’t received feedback by February 8, 2016 your application could not be considered.
