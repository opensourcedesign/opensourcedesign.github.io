Foss responders is a community initiative that started out to support Foss organisations and projects in the face of coronavirus when events and conferences were being cancelled and Foss orgs were struggling to meet fundraising target. Foss responders started out to support those needs.

The design has currently been done by two designers (Eriol Fox and Jay Sethi) with support from others across the volunteers of Foss responder volunteers. The website is overdue a better design approach and is difficult to do with a 'solo' designer who often does the product management work too.
