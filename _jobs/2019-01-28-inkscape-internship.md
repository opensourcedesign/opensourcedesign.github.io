​Hi,

I’m offering an internship position for a project focused on Inkscape.

The internship will last 3 months full time, but can also be split in smaller part-time chucks. The workplace is a coworking space in the center of Bordeaux.

People applying must have the following skills :

1) Show a good knowledge of Inkscape interface and workflow
2) Speak one of the following languages: English, French, Italian, Spanish, Catalan or Portuguese

- The main tasks will be creating flat designs, assets and isometric blocks using Inkscape.
- The laptop is not provided, so people should bring their own laptop and work with it,

The total amount paid for the 3 months is around 1600€ net, which is the standard salary for internships here in France.

If you are interested in the position, please send your resume and any kind of support showing your Inkscape skills (portfolio, website) to the following address: fanialivio@gmail.com

No motivation letter required.

Livio
