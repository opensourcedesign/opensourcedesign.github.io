Patchwork is a tool used for parse mails from a development mailing list, extract any patches, and display in a web UI. Patchwork is widely deployed around the internet: sites include [kernel.org](https://patchwork.kernel.org/), [ozlabs.org](https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/), [dpdk.org](http://dpdk.org/dev/patchwork/) and [linaro.org](https://patches.linaro.org/).

Patchwork is undergoing a lot of development at this time, and as part of that redesign we need a simple logo. The logo will be displayed prominently on many of the Patchwork instances, once updated to the latest version. In addition, credits with be included on the [about](https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/help/about/) page for each instance.

Below are some keywords, in case they are helpful:
- mailing list
- email
- patch
- code review
- source control
- linux
