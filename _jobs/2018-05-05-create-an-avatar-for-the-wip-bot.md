The current avatar of the [WIP app](https://github.com/apps/wip) was meant as a placeholder. Now that it’s quite popular it would be nice if we could create a proper logo for it. 

I am not good at this :D But I thought maybe we could manage to make some kind of combination of a 
🤖 robot head and the letters WIP that create a face

But hey I’m open to suggestions.

I’ll give full credit for the logo in the repository’s README and would also donate $50 in your honour to [Rails Girls Summer of Code](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) or similar initiatives.
