As part of the Open Tech Fund Usability Lab, we at Ura Design (https://ura.design) are redesigning OTF's Impact page:
https://www.opentech.fund/results/impacts-and-outcomes/

We are currently in the process of doing so. As part of this, we will also require 10-20 illustrations/icons to illustrate each data point. The preferred illustration style will be flat(ish) and hopefully offer a base for an illustration style we can use in the future as well. You will be working with us on this project (Brand and UX Designers, also part of Open Source Design).

Budget is available and can be set hourly, per illustration/icon or overall project.
