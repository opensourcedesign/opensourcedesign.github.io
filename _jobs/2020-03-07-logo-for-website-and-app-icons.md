Pandoc is a universal document converter and publishing tool, capable of converting between a multitude of formats. Despite being a comparatively old open source project (turning 14 this year), pandoc does not yet have a logo or specific design. There have been long [discussions](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/pandoc-discuss/1bKIuyBnWaQ/discussion) about the topic, with ideas proposed over the past years – all failed, often because the designs were unusable as icons and/or not polished enough to be chosen as an official logo.

The current favorite seems to be a reverse [pilcrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilcrow); but again, our community's missing design capabilities got in the way. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
