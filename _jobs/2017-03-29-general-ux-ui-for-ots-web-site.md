OpenTechSchool, is a distributed community initiative organising welcoming and inclusive code learning happenings with real people in the real world. Our offers are for technology enthusiasts of all ages, genders, backgrounds, and experience levels. 
We support whoever wants to learn with co-learning events or one day workshop all made possible by volunteers coaches. 

We are in the process to recreate our website design. 
We can reuse a lot of our current design items but the UX it really to be re-think.
We already have done some work about it and we are in the process of re-building but we need some help since not so many of us are design skilled.
The idea would be to help with basic UI items and general template from which we can create all the other part of the website.
