Backbone is an experimental public web api application. Users can create a backend application (database / web api) through Backbone. It aims to help developers to create app prototypes for their front-end applications.

It has been developed by Angular Material (and Material design). It needs some face-lifting, colors, design, especially for create/manage web api pages.
