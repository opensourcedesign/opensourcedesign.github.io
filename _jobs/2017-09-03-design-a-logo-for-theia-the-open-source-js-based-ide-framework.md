Theia is a cloud & desktop IDE framework implemented in TypeScript. Read more here: http://typefox.io/theia-one-ide-for-desktop-cloud.

Theia needs a logo that will be used on the github as well as in other marketing materials, e.g. a website, a twitter account and so on.  The work should be openly tracked on this issue: https://github.com/theia-ide/theia/issues/454. You can start by submitting there your sketches.

Deliveries should be in (1) the raw format for editing and in (2) png/jpg format. Deliveries should also come in different sizes, i.e. it should look nice as a small icon as well.
