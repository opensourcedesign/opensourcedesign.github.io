We are looking for designer who can help us to make a brand guideline for our project.
Now we have OpenVZ sites (mirrors.openvz.org, planet.openvz.org, lists.openvz.org etc)
which looks differently. So we want to define design rules for font, colours, logos etc
and make our sites similar by design. Something like other opensource projects have.
See - https://openvz.org/Brand-guidelines#Guidelines_of_other_opensource_projects

We are non-commercial non-profitable project and we have only one source of money -
donations to OpenVZ project. Please take it into account.
