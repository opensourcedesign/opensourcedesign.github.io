If you have questions relating to Open Source Design that **are not mentioned
below** please [open an issue](https://github.com/opensourcedesign/organization).

### What Does Involvement In OSD Mean

It means whatever you want it to mean. You can design, code, blog, give design
feedback, help fundraise, you name it- we would love your contributions. Check
out how to [best contribute](/contribute/).

### Who Can Join

Anyone can join. Ideally, we want people who contribute something, even if that
means just leaving comments on various issues, as long as they're helpful and
nice, we welcome you :)

### What Does Being a Member Mean

Open Source Design offers a "choose-your-own" style of membership, it means you
are welcome to active engage [in our forum](https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net) or [apply for design jobs](/jobs/). You can help [work on our website](https://github.com/opensourcedesign/opensourcedesign.net/issues) or [attend and organize events](/events/). Also you can just chill in our [chat room](http://chat.opensourcedesign.net) and provide help to newcommers to be considered a community member. In short, and unofficially, there is no "membership" card, fees, or requirements aside from following our [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct/) and you are involved over some duration of time.

### What Does Being a Core Member Mean

The community has not reached a clear consensus on this, but we have had [some discussion](
https://github.com/opensourcedesign/organization/issues/61) on the subject. Extracting sentiment from that thread, as well as offline conversations, the loosely constructed basics are:

- Regulary contribute to OSD and / or open source in general
- Have been consistently active in OSD for longer than 6 months
- Assume some responsibility for some aspect of OSD
- Have met other core members in real life at least once

### Why "Open Source" not "Free Software"

Our name choice was never an intentional decision or discussion. In our earliest
organizing we just started intuitively *using* our name (Open Source Design) and
it stuck. The reasons we feel good about this choice are:

1. The Free as in beer / freedom confusion
2. Free Software is older and has a specific community, culture, and goals
3. Open source is a newer term and can have broader goals
4. Open source has done a better job at outreach and has broader public
   understanding at present
5. Open source (and especially design) extends beyond software to hardware, architecture, manufacturing, and more
6. Acronyms like FOSS, FLOSS are not user friendly and pertain to just software
7. Spelling out said acronyms is also not designer / user friendly

### Do You Care About Free Software

Absolutely. Free software is incredibly important to many of our founders and core
members. Most of us use and rely on free software daily and wouldn't be here without it. While we are aware of the definitions of "open source" vs. "free software" and the inherent debate, despite Free Software Foundation's ask to "[choose a side](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html)", OSD as a community has picked a name, but is absolutely not choosing a political side with our choice. However, many of us agree with the FSF's principles in full and have dedicated our lives to working exclusively on free software or open source technologies.

### How are you different from Open Design

There is a community called [Open Design](http://opendesign.foundation) that
sometimes gets confused as us. From [this conversation](https://github.com/opensourcedesign/resources/issues/14) our differences are:

> Open Source Design is building a community of designers working on open
> source, while Open Design is focusing on building open workflows for
> designers.  Open Design is not building tools for the sake of building tools,
> but to build a community of designers working towards more open practices.

Open Design targets the wider design community, while Open Source Design targets
getting more people (including designers) involved in designing for Open Source
Software. This image by [GarthDB](https://garthdb.com) does a good job of
explaining:
