Hello all! I'm Una (pronounced you-na). I'm a [designer](http://unakravets.com) and [developer](http://una.github.io) living in Austin, Texas where I'm working on the [Watson](https://github.com/IBM-Watson/patterns) team at IBM (where I've been a big advocate of open source and where we JUST got a little approval for it!). Like @GarthDB said, I've joined him and @terracomma on [Design Open](http://designopen.org) and I am pretty involved in the Sass community. I started two Sass [meetups](http://atxsass.com). I contribute to a few various (mostly Sass-related) open source projects.

I'm _really_ happy and excited to work with you all to promote open source design. I've met a lot of people at conferences and other events who are also super supportive of this initiative!
