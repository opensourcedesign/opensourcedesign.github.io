I'm Simon Vansintjan - a developer / user experience designer based in Hanoi, Vietnam who's interested in slow web, social responsibility, communities, and the commons beyond computer science terminology. I'm a core contributor to [OpenFarm](http://openfarm.cc) where I build and design full-stack using Ruby and JavaScript. I prefer Python. I run a weekly newsletter called [UX Weekly](http://uxwkly.com) that focuses on high quality user experience material.
