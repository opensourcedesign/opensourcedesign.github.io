Hi! I'm Patrick - a design and dev enthusiast living in Raleigh, NC. I have a passion for development and
am currently learning more about open source design. I currently work as a core contributor on the [Patternfly](http://patternfly.org) team at Red Hat.
I am also active with the javascript community here in RTP.

When I'm not working on the web or exploring mobile apps, I enjoy hiking, biking, and camping. I also have a strong
passion for IoT gadgets like the Raspberry Pi and configuring the Pi to run my home electronics.
