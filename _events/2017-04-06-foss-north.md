### Talk Proposal

#### Title

The UX of UX - Behind the scenes of effectively designing in the open

#### Descripion

Open source software has always been engineering driven. Most of the people building open source software are
engineers with major turn on for features and more features which kind of explains how a lot of open source
projects have rich and extremely important features but are a pain to see or work with. This talk aims to deal
with this problem of designing in the open which is often neglected. Tools like GitHub, GitLab, etc. can actually
become an arena for usability testing and give extremely promising output only if it follows an effective design
process. This talk is also a practical guide for budding designers to get started with open source software.

#### About the speaker

Ragy Nayyar, 23, is a post graduate student in Interaction Design at KTH, Stockholm. Prior to this he has worked,
both as a designer and a developer for both big companies and startups for around 2 years. He has been a
contributor to open source since he started writing code and majority of my contributions are related to
front-end programming and user experience decisions. He started contributing to ownCloud when they were not
even on GitHub, but on Gitorious and now its one of the highest contributed PHP project on GitHub. He does
pretty much the same thing at Nextcloud now in his free time. He co-authored and designed the Nextcloud and
ownCloud calendar which is one of the most famous self hosted calendar solutions. He loves writing CSS and
building scalable CSS architectures.
