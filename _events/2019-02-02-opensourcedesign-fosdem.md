[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) is the Free and Open source Software Developers’ European Meeting, a free and non-commercial two-day weekend event that offers **all** open source contributors a place to meet, share ideas, learn and collaborate.

After successful runs in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, there will be a design devroom at FOSDEM 2019!

The Open Source Design devroom will take place on **Saturday, February 2nd**, in the [Solbosch campus of the Université Libre Brussels](https://osm.org/go/0EoSssl_x-?way=150213175). The exact room will be confirmed in the coming months.

This will be a full day of talks about design work on free, libre and open source projects.

**We invite you to send in your submissions about design work on free, libre and open source projects.**

We mean ‘design’ in the broadest sense: user research, interface and interaction design, information architecture, visual design, typography, illustration, iconography, accessibility ... – all in the context of open source projects, which we believe introduces unique challenges.

Designers and developers working with designers (or on a design-minded project) are welcome to submit proposals.

Possible topics include:

- FOSS design tools
- Unique challenges that open source brings
- Design techniques and deliverables
- Design/engineering collaboration approaches
- User engagement and design research activities
- Project case studies

In the past we've had talks about [getting designers involved in open source](https://archive.fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/osd_get_designers_involved/), [accessibility in open source](https://archive.fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/osd_accessibility_in_os/), [application design and development](https://archive.fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/osd_gnome_recipe_app/), [beyond logos](https://archive.fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/osd_beyond_fancy_logo/), [architectural font digitisation and design](https://archive.fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/osd_architectural_font_digitalisation/) and lots more.
