## Open Source Design Devroom Call for Participation

This is the Call for Participation for the FOSDEM 2017 Open Source Design devroom. We invite you to send in your submissions about design work on free, libre and open source projects.

[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) is the Free and Open source Software Developers’ European Meeting, a free and non-commercial two-day weekend event that offers open source contributors a place to meet, share ideas and collaborate.

After successful runs in 2015 and 2016, there will be again a design devroom at FOSDEM 2017: a full day of talks about design work on free, libre and open source projects. The Open Source Design devroom will take place on **Sunday, February 5th**.

We mean ‘design’ in the broadest sense: user research, interface and interaction design, information architecture, visual design, typography, illustration, iconography, accessibility ... – all in the context of open source projects, which we believe introduces unique challenges. Designers and developers working with designers (or on a design-minded project) are welcome to submit proposals.

Possible topics include:

- FOSS design tools
- Design techniques and deliverables
- Design - engineering collaboration approaches
- User engagement and design research activities
- Project case studies
