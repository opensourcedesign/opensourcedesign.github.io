SCaLE 16X – the 16th annual Southern California Linux Expo – will take place on March. 8-11, 2018, at the [Pasadena Convention Center](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/16x/venue).
SCaLE 16X expects to host 150 exhibitors this year, along with nearly 130 sessions, tutorials and special events.
SCaLE is the largest community-run open-source and free software conference in North America. It is held annually in the greater Los Angeles area.

This year the organizers have agreed to hosting a Libre Graphics track at the expo.
The team is reaching out to all in the graphic and design community to come out and spend a day together helping to spread awareness of libre graphics tools, processes, and community.

Participation and attendance is totally free, though the organisers gratefully accept donations and sponsorship.
