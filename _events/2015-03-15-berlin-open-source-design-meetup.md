Let’s meet and work on driving the Open Soure Design movement forward! Everyone who wants to contribute is welcome.

## Results & todos!

We discussed via conference call and [etherpad](http://piratepad.net/fBoG0xwOiQ) what we want to achieve with this movement. These are the next steps for everyone who attended to make that real:

- [ ] Brennan: get the IRC web chat (Matrix) set up so others can join
- [ ] Danila: aggregate existing open source design projects and their processes
- [ ] Jan: put the "what we want to achieve" up as a first opensourcedesign.net frontpage
- [ ] Kriesse: collect resources for how to make designers contributors
- [ ] Gilli: create guidelines on how designers and developers can communicate better
- [ ] Implement a Code of Conduct, e.g. like http://hood.ie/code-of-conduct/ (talk to Jan Lehnardt about forking this, also see: https://adainitiative.org/2014/02/howto-design-a-code-of-conduct-for-your-community/)
      If you want to join, just pick a task from the pad or do something you are interested in to drive the initiative forward! :)

**What we want to achieve with Open Source Design**

- open up the design process (Danila)

  - find existing projects with open design processes (Mozilla, Canonical)

- make designers contributors (Kriesse)

  - git workshops
  - provide resources about how to collaborate for designers
  - meetups / events / hackathons for designers who want to contribute to OS

  - think about how to make OS contributions more rewarding and attractive for designers

- communication between designers and developers (Gilli)

  - easier way to use IRC (Brennan, Jan, Gilli)
  - a job board for designers to find open source projects (Brennan, Jan) – check to collaborate with OpenHatch: http://openhatch.org/
  - develop guidelines on how to write documentation, issues, comments that designers (or non-technical contributors in general) can work with (Kriesse)
  - create guidelines on how to present a design to a community with reasoning. And how the community can review the design in a constructive way. (Gilli)
