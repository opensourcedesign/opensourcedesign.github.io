[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) is the Free and Open source Software Developers’ European Meeting, a free and non-commercial two-day weekend event that offers open source contributors a place to meet, share ideas and collaborate.

After successful runs in 2015, 2016 and 2017, there will be again a design devroom at FOSDEM 2018: a full day of talks about design work on free, libre and open source projects. The Open Source Design devroom will take place on **Sunday, February 4th**.

**We invite you to send in your submissions about design work on free, libre and open source projects.**

We mean ‘design’ in the broadest sense: user research, interface and interaction design, information architecture, visual design, typography, illustration, iconography, accessibility ... – all in the context of open source projects, which we believe introduces unique challenges. Designers and developers working with designers (or on a design-minded project) are welcome to submit proposals.

Possible topics include:

- FOSS design tools
- Design techniques and deliverables
- Design - engineering collaboration approaches
- User engagement and design research activities
- Project case studies
