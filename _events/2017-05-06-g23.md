The Chaos Computer Club Berlin organized a [G23 unconference](https://twitter.com/clubdiscordia/status/860887084130848768), bringing together activists on privacy, decentralization and related topics.

We briefly presented Open Source Design under the title **Du hast was gehackt, aber aufs Design gekackt?** (loosely translated **You hacked a bit but the design is shit?**).

We have [a tweet about the funny session title](https://twitter.com/reginasipos/status/860569645815922688). ;)
