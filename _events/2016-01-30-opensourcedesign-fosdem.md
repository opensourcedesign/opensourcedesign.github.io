[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) is one of the biggest open source conferences. For the second time there will be a dedicated Open Source Design track.

The call for participation is now open. Dead line for submitting your proposals is **December 8th 2015**

The full call for participation is below.

## Open Source Design Devroom Call for Participation

This is the Call for Participation for the FOSDEM 2016 Open Source Design devroom. We invite you to send in your submissions about design work on free, libre and open source projects.

[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) is the Free and Open source Software Developers’ European Meeting, a free and non-commercial two-day weekend event that offers open source contributors a place to meet, share ideas and collaborate.

After a successful run in 2015, there will be again a design devroom at FOSDEM 2016: a full day of talks about design work on free, libre and open source projects. The Open Source Design devroom will take place on **Saturday, January 30th**.

We mean ‘design’ in the broadest sense: user research, interface and interaction design, information architecture, visual design, typography, illustration, iconography, accessibility ... – all in the context of open source projects, which we believe introduces unique challenges. Designers and developers working with designers (or on a design-minded project) are welcome to submit proposals.

Possible topics include:

- FOSS design tools
- Design techniques and deliverables
- Design - engineering collaboration approaches
- User engagement and design research activities
- Project case studies
