Thanks to an invitation by the awesome organizers, we were part of the community space at [CSSconf EU](https://2017.cssconf.eu/)! :)

We had a short session for introducing Open Source Design, and also to showcase some well-designed open source projects to get involved with.

There’s a [tweet about it](https://twitter.com/opensrcdesign/status/860410556515221504) too. :)
