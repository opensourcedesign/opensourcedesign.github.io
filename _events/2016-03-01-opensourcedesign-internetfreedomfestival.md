[The Internet Freedom Festival](https://internetfreedomfestival.org/) creates a common space where diverse communities working against and affected by censorship and surveillance can come together to teach, plan and act.

This year there will be a usability and design track which connects designers, users and developers to keep the tools secure and usable.

This include brainstorm sessions for new and improved tools, usability workshops for developers and opportunities for users to share their highly valuable experience and recommendations. [Usability and design track](https://internetfreedomfestival.org/#tracks/).

The call for session proposals is for designers, user researchers (and everyone working in user experience) who want to contribute their knowledge, experience or time to projects working on Internet freedom, anti-censorship and surveillance.

[Closing date for submitting a session proposal is the 8th of January](https://internetfreedomfestival.org/host-a-session/)
