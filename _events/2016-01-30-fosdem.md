[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2016/) is a free and non-commercial event organised by the community for the community. The goal is to provide free and open source software developers and communities a place to meet to:

- get in touch with other developers and projects;
- be informed about the latest developments in the free software world;
- be informed about the latest developments in the open source world;
- attend interesting talks and presentations on various topics by project leaders and committers;
- to promote the development and benefits of free software and open source solutions.

Participation and attendance is totally free, though the organisers gratefully accept donations and sponsorship.
