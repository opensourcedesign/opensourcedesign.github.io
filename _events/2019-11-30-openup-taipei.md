A workshop organised by the team from Open Design + Ushahidi hosted and supported by [Open UP global summit](https://www.openup.global/). It will take place in Taipei, Taiwan.

The 'Open Design' workshop which is testing a methodology, workshop structure, and repo/file set-up in order to see if we can boost design contributions to a specific open-source product. For the first two workshops, we’re using Ushahidi’s TenFour tool which is a crisis communication tool.

We’ll be looking at how designers can improve certain issues within the TenFour repo with the context being around the [Tropical Cyclones and Typoons](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1183963/typhoon-mitag-tracker-taiwan-japan-korea-2019-storm-latest-path-map-cyclone-mitag).

If any OSD folks are around the area please let me know if you’d like to be part of the team in delivering the workshop and/or a participant.
