[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2018/) is a free and non-commercial event organised by the community for the community. The goal is to provide free and open source software developers and communities a place to meet, share ideas and collaborate.

After three successful hosting of devrooms at FOSDEM 2015, 2016 and 2017, we would like to repeat the experience this year again. Since the beginning of Open Source Design community (http://opensourcedesign.net/) we promoted several initiatives, like having a "jobs board" where FOSS projects looking for design contributors can connect with available designers.
The goal of this devroom is to showcase design work done within free and open source projects, and strengthen the connections between designers involved in FOSS. We mean "design" in a broad sense, and we include within that term typography, graphic design, interaction design, user experience and design research activities.

Participation and attendance is totally free, though the organisers gratefully accept donations and sponsorship.
