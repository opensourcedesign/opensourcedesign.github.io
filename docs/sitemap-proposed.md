## Proposed Navigation

### Header

| Position | Label | URL | Type | Notes |

| 2 | Events | /events/ | Internal | |
| 3 | Resources | /resources/ | Internal | Label stays "Resources" for now; can be changed to "Getting Started" once the page is live |
| 4 | Jobs | /jobs/ | External (sub-repo) | |
| 5 | Forum | /forum/ | Internal (links out) | |

### Footer

| Label | URL | Type | Notes |
|-------|-----|------|-------|
| GitHub | https://github.com/opensourcedesign | External | |
| Mastodon | https://fosstodon.org/@opensourcedesign | External | Fix: current footer points to wrong instance (issue #11) |

List any pages that need to be created from scratch.

| Proposed URL | Title | Content description | Source material |
|--------------|-------|---------------------|-----------------|
| /about-us/ | About Us | Landing page for the About section; absorbs Goals and FAQ content; TOC at top linking to sub-pages (Manifesto, How to Join, CoC, Governance, By-laws) | `/goals/`, `/faq/` content + new writing |

| /resources/ | Resources | Lead article "Being a designer in open source" (#505) + community-curated resource database | `/articles/` (non-event content), `/resources/`, new external list; label can be changed to "Getting Started" later |

---

## New homepage details

- Remove filler header image
- move first paragraph front and center as hero section
- 2nd and 3rd paragraph are their own sections with more weight, maybe add photos of OSDN at conferences, etc.?, so pe
- Add sidebar with Events, Calendar: time-sensitive and engaging (design exploration needed, proposal incoming)
- Separate Jobs section (box?)
- Articles: remove section - will get dissolved into event write-ups on the one hand, and filed under the new page "getting started" on the other hand
- New section as a CTA to support in multiple ways
  - Supporters: button should be a clear CTA
  - Contributors&Backers: add a CTA
- Conferences: remove section and add logos to side bar (explore mini card design)
- Affiliates: merge supporters and affiliates into a more compact form
- Contact us (socials) is a duplicate of the footer, remove! also: remove Code of Conduct from here, remove Twitter

---

## Footer changes

- Remove "Edit this page" and "View source code" (Github is linked, we are not in the business of educating designers how github works)
- Remove Twitter
- Remove CoC link (more prominently under "about us")
- Add Imprint (Open Collective is our fiscal sponsor)

---

## Events page redesign

- Keep it as a list (ticker, not a blog post feel)
- Some of the items will have a write-up attached
- The date should be hard-coded, and homepage will pull from there to display "upcoming events"

---

## New "Getting Started" page (keep "Resources" as title for now, still tdb)

- Lead article on "Being a designer in open source" (#505)
- Underneath that is a community-curated database of resources
  - Pulls from /articles/ (anything that isn't an event write-up), current /resources/, and a new list that's been created externally
- Design incoming, but site structure can already be set up

---

## Removed Pages

List any pages that should not exist in the new site.

| Current URL | Disposition | Redirect to (if applicable) | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------------|-------|
| /goals/ | merged into /about-us/ | /about-us/ | |
| /faq/ | merged into /about-us/ | /about-us/ | |
| /processes/ | removed | /about-us/governance/ | Thin content; governance is closest match |
| /articles/ | removed | per post | Each post URL redirects to its new home: event write-ups → /events/:slug/; rest → /resources/:slug/ |
| /people/ | removed entirely | — | No replacement |
| /contribute/ | removed | /about-us/how-to-join/ | |
| /contributing/ | removed | /about-us/how-to-join/ | |
| /people-form/ | removed | — | Staticman API broken; no replacement form planned |
| /logos/ | removed | — | No redirect |
| /summit/ | removed | /events/ | Redirect to events listing |
| /summit/2017 | removed | /events/ | Redirect to events listing |
