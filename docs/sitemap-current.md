## Navigation

### Header

The header is a fixed-top Bootstrap navbar. Links are driven by `_data/global.yml` → `header_links`.
The brand logo always links to `/#page-top` (homepage scroll anchor).

| Position | Label | URL | Type | Source |
|----------|-------|-----|------|--------|
| Brand | Open Source Design (logo) | /#page-top | Internal | hardcoded in `_includes/header.html` |
| 1 | Goals | /goals/ | Internal | `_data/global.yml` |
| 2 | Articles | /articles/ | Internal | `_data/global.yml` |
| 3 | Resources | /resources/ | Internal | `_data/global.yml` |
| 4 | Jobs | https://opensourcedesign.net/jobs/ | External (sub-repo) | `_data/global.yml` |
| 5 | Events | /events/ | Internal | `_data/global.yml` |
| 6 | Forum | https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net/ | External | `_data/global.yml` |

**No dropdown menus.** All nav items are flat top-level links.
Active state is applied when `page.url == link.url` (exact match only).

### Footer

The footer has two distinct zones. Links are hardcoded in `_includes/footer.html`
(not driven by a data file).

**Social / community links** (rendered as `<ul>` with icons):

| Label | URL | Type | Note |
|-------|-----|------|------|
| opensourcedesign (GitHub) | https://github.com/opensourcedesign | External | Value from `site.github_username` |
| @opensourcedesign (Mastodon) | https://mastodon.social/@opensourcedesign | External | Bug: template uses `mastodon.social` but account is on `fosstodon.org` |
| Open Collective | https://opencollective.com/opensourcedesign | External | Hardcoded URL |
| Join our forum | https://discourse.opensourcedesign.net | External | Hardcoded URL |
| Code of Conduct | /code-of-conduct/ | Internal | Uses `site.url` variable |

**Per-page utility links** (rendered above the social list, on every page):

| Label | URL pattern | Type |
|-------|-------------|------|
| Edit this page | `https://github.com/opensourcedesign/opensourcedesign.github.io/edit/master/{{ page.path }}` | External |
| View source code | `https://github.com/opensourcedesign/opensourcedesign.github.io/blob/master/{{ page.path }}` | External |
