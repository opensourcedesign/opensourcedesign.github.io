      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Below is a list of projects we're currently focused on.
      </p>
      <h4>Logo</h4>
      <p>We just chose our logo. <a href="https://github.com/opensourcedesign/opensourcedesign.github.io/issues/18">Check out the issue</a>, where you'll see current thoughts, beautiful concepts, and generally a lot of enthusiasm.</p>
      <h4>Jobs Page</h4>
      <p>A job board for medium- to large-sized design tasks from open source projects.<br>
      <a href="/jobs/">Check out open source design jobs</a></p>
      <h4>Events Page</h4>
      <p>Icon workshops, designing and hacks, planning, help shape what Open Source Design is about.<br>
      <a href="/events/">Participate in an upcoming event</a></p>
      <h4>Chat App</h4>
      <p>A nice chat app for open source developers and designers to collaborate. It uses IRC as base technology since most open source projects use IRC and it’s an open protocol unlike modern chat & collaboration apps. We’re basing it off <a href="http://shout-irc.com/" target="_blank">Shout</a>.</p>
