We're always excited to have new contributors. Our community is diverse in
ages, cultures, and interests so we like to operate under the motto:

> If you have a creative idea or something you want bring to the table,
> just do it ;-)

However, it can also be good to check-in if you're new and unsure about things.
Please read our [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct/) and take a moment to
consider how you can best contribute to Open Source Design.
