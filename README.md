## Edit Website

Editing content on [opensourcedesign.net][osd-net] can be done in 3 ways, all of which require a GitHub account.

1. Using GitHub's nifty file editor, which is quick but limited:

2. [Using Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/opensourcedesign/opensourcedesign.github.io) which gives you a preconfigured IDE and live preview. This is quick and you can see your changes:

3. Setting the website up locally, which is more technical.

## Code & Design The Website

You need some basic ability to use a terminal as well as some knowledge of web
development like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site is built with the following
programming tools:

- [Jekyll][jekyll]
- [Bootstrap][bootstrap]

### Installing

This step requires having a `ruby` development environment and `git` installed
and configured to connect to GitHub with SSH.

- [Installing Ruby][installing-ruby]
- [Using GitHub with SSH][github-ssh]

1. Install Jekyll using and other Ruby gems

```sh
sudo gem install bundler
```

2. Fork and clone the main website repository

```sh
git clone --single-branch --branch master https://github.com/opensourcedesign/opensourcedesign.github.io.git
cd opensourcedesign.github.io/
bundle install
```

3. Clone the jobs repository

Currently the job board is still a separate repository, but [we plan to move it in here](https://github.com/opensourcedesign/opensourcedesign.github.io/issues/236).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/opensourcedesign/jobs.git
```

4. Build the static site & watch for files

```sh
bundler exec jekyll serve --watch --config _config.yml,_config-dev.yml
```
