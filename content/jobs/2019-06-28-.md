Wobbly is a chat app similar to whatsapp, but specifically for starting a union in a workplace.

We have a logo and are currently using a standard design system that we're ok with using as a starting point (Material Design), but we'd really like to get a more unique look and feel to the app. Mocking up a few screens from feature ideas would be great, and also participating in discussions around approaches to features.

We're looking to create a more diverse team so if you are not a white man please click through on our job!
