Owncast is the free and open source live video streaming + chat server, allowing anybody to run their self-hosted live streams similar to the large big tech options.

The project has hit five years old, and it's time to give our home page and documentation a facelift.

We're looking to redesign our home landing page to improve how we explain the project to people, add a bit more levity to our image, and simply freshen things up.

As a small Open Source project, our budget isn't huge. But we want to be able to offer something to somebody talented who is excited to work with us.
