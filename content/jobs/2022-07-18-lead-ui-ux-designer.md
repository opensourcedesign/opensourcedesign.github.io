The Fairfield Programming Association is hosting a coding competition between the React Native and Flutter community to determine which is the better framework. For this, we need designs of our platform for many different devices like mobile, tablets, computers, and tv. The work can be done in whatever platform of your choice, and if you would like help with the project, we are more than happy to bring in more team members to help.
