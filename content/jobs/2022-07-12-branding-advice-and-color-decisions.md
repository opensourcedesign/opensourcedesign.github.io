deliverables: "You tell us! \U0001F601 We'll take whatever you can give us.\r\nGuidance? Expert advice. Something more?\r\n\r\nMaybe a Brand Book (Lite!) that builds on our [Doctopus](https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/brand-assets) and includes color decisions, how to use the logo, etc."
how_to_apply:
  - Felicity Brand
  - "The  project lives on GitHub: https://github.com/thegooddocsproject\r\n\r\n* We've already got our Doctopus mascot design - which we use as a logo: https://github.com/thegooddocsproject/brand-assets\r\n* We've already got a design for our [Chronologue](https://chronologue.netlify.app/Community)\r\n* We think our [blog](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/blog/) looks quite nice."

The content strategy working group of [The Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/) is about to embark on a refresh of our website. 

We are a group of technical writers and developers, and would love input from a designer.

We want to choose a new theme, and it would be good to make some pre-emptive creative decisions to make our lives easier when applying that theme. For example, we'll need to answer questions like "Which blue? Now we need another color - what contrasts well with this blue? Is it accessible?" etc.

Our project has a main product: templates. It also has subsidiary products, one of which, the Chronologue, has its own branding (this is already established). We've also got a blog. 

We need a primary and secondary color scheme to gives us enough flexibility to tie our products in to the one family. We'll probably use a Hugo theme, and a [theme color generator](https://daisyui.com/theme-generator/) but it would be nice to get input from a designer.

Come along to a [meeting](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/community/) and have a chat.  Or join us in [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/thegooddocs/shared_invite/zt-be2gay0m-Ukq_5SI0MHp20IQP3auQjg).

We're all volunteers on this project, so we can't pay you.
