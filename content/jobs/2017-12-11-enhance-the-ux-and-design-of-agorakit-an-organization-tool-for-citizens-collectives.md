Agorakit is web-based, open source groupware for citizens. 
By creating collaborative groups, people can discuss topics, organize events, store files and keep everyone updated as needed. 
Agorakit is a forum, calendar, file manager, mapping tool and email notifier.

The current user interface is based on Tailwind with some small parts of bootstrap (with Laravel on the server). I, the main dev, and our thousands of users around the world would really benefit from your experience in user interface design and usability.
