At openSUSE we participate every year in several open source mentoring programs like [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4794149198888960/)  or [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/).
To centralize and organize our efforts we created the [openSUSE 101](http://101.opensuse.org/) mentoring program.
As motivation for our students we would like to hand out a welcome bag including an openSUSE Summer of Code Shirt.

We're looking for someone designing a nice shirt for the openSUSE Summer of Code.
The shirt could include for instance our [openSUSE logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/98/OpenSUSE_official-logo-color.svg/1280px-OpenSUSE_official-logo-color.svg.png) and/or some project logos from [openSUSE101](http://101.opensuse.org/).
