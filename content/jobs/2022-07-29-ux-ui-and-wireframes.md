LeaderboardsGG is an open source replacement for a heavily used, corporate-sold competitive leaderboard website.

We need help with making wireframes for a somewhat complex website. We have a ton of user feedback, have our mvp functions outlined (might be missing things). You would be able to help pull it all together so we have a deliverable that we can give to the front end developers, who are ready.
