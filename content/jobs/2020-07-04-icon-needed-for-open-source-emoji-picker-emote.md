Emote currently simply uses an emoji from the Twitter emoji set as its icon. This is by definition not unique at all and I don't think is particularly aesthetically pleasing either.

I think it would be great if we could come up with a simple logo that is simple, memorable and unique. It doesn't need to be anything particularly elaborate. It should make sense in the context of it being an emoji picker.

As Emote is a linux app and is predominantly used on the Gnome desktop environment, the icon should conform to the Gnome Human Interface Guidelines for icons, which can be found here - https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/icon-design.html.en.
