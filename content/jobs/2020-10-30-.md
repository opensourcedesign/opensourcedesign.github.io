So here is what i would need. I need an Icon in SVG for an SD Card in the menubar of macos. It should look similar to the Battery icon of macos. So if the SD-Card is in the Laptop: The SD-Card Icon would be full like the full battery indicator. If the SD-Card is missing it would be just the outline of the SD-Card, like an empy battery. The outline should clearly make it visible as sd-card. I have two design choices in mind. I would also need this for the dark and the light theme. Please see the Github Issue for more details:
