Canonical is the company behind Ubuntu, the leading operating system for container, cloud, internet of things and hyperscale computing, central to modern tech from development to production.

Our design team, centred in Europe, has specialists in visual and UX design, and front and back end development. We collaborate, as product design squads, with global distributed development engineering teams.

We count on our team to bring together deep design-thinking, technical domain knowledge, with great instincts, through a rigorous process – to shape products for a very demanding audience. You’ll fit in if you have equal appetites for design, innovation and technology.

## What you will be doing

You will be part of a team working on web applications for enterprise cloud services, IoT and embedded devices, bringing exciting new projects to life and improving existing ones.

- You will be leading your product-specific projects, driving design and delivery against agreed goals and working with designers, product management and engineering to deliver on the strategic vision for Canonical.
- You will plan and conduct research with target users and stakeholders from the business to identify and document users' needs and requirements as well as business requirements and KPIs
- You will manage incoming requests for work that affects you and needs to be considered (e.g. project briefs) and balance and prioritise the various projects’ requirements. In your day to day you are defining the scope, milestones and deliverables for any given iteration.
- You apply agile/lean project management methodologies. You will be the person resolving any blockers on your projects, through clear communication with project management and actively seeking help from team members, your manager and others.
- You will liaise with relevant stakeholders and engineers to achieve company goals, making time to talk via messaging applications, setting up and attending regular meetings, reviewing work with them in advance, sharing progress and seeking their input to achieve consensus and drive progress. 
- We try as much as we can to share our experiences and knowledge within the team and to the community through informal presentations, the design blog and other events. 
- Driving the adoption of Vanilla, our front end framework. You will be encouraging teammates to use or iterate existing patterns or when desired to design new patterns that are used across Canonical products and available as an open source resource.
