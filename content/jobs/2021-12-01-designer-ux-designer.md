CORRECITV is a non-profit investigative journalism organisation from Germany. 
We develop various software solutions that support our investigations with the community. For this we need support in the areas of backend and frontend development as well as UX and design. If you enjoy working on civic tech projects and would like to help develop processes for the quality journalism of tomorrow in an international team, then apply with a short cover letter, your résumé and work samples (e.g. Gitlab / Github). 

These are the three projects we are currently working on: 

CROWDNEWSROOM

The CrowdNewsroom is a platform for journalists who want to do investigations together with their readers. CORRECTIV has carried out a wide range of complex investigations with the help of citizens via the platform. The crowd newsroom allows the secure sharing of data, documents and personal stories and their verification and evaluation by the editorial team.

Backend: Django, Python 3.6
Frontend: react, vue.js

Github Frontend: https://github.com/correctiv/crowdnewsroom-frontend
Github backend: https://github.com/correctiv/crowdnewsroom-backend

BEABEE

With beabee we want to enable independent local newsrooms across Europe to successfully start and run community-centered and member-financed media organisations.

For this purpose, we develop open source technology that allows community editors to better understand their members and to involve them effectively in their work. Readers become active informants, members, supporters, volunteers or employees. 

beabee is being developed in partnership between CORRECTIV, Bristol Cable and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism in the UK and Veronica from the Netherlands. The project is funded by the Ruhr Conference at the State Chancellery of North Rhine-Westphalia.

Backend: TypeScript, Node.js
Frontend: vue.js

NOFAKE

The NoFake project is about the automation of monitoring processes in order to identify false online information and about the support in the research to refute it.

CORRECTIV has been working in the field of fact checking and disinformation since 2017 and wants to integrate more volunteers into the fact checking process in a meaningful way. Together with the Ruhr University Bochum and the Technical University of Dortmund, CORRECTIV is therefore carrying out a project that aims to develop technical methods to support the fight against disinformation.

The project focus of CORRECTIV is "Recognizing and combating digital" disinformation campaigns ". To this end, we are building a community of committed citizens who are able to recognize disinformation and counteract it through fact checks. At the same time we train artificial intelligence during this process. The software we are building will support this process.

The project is still at the very beginning. It is important that it is technically closely interlinked with beabee and the Crowdnewsroom. Exact requirements will be worked out in the coming weeks.
