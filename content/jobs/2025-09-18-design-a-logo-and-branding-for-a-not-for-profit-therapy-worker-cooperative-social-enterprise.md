Logo design, Branding of a design or visual language that we can use to create our website

Compensation: gratis / minimal expenses

Hello and thank you for reading,

We are a south east London-based start up trying to get a website up and running as the next step in developing our project.

Our goal is to make therapy space more accessible to local therapists and in turn make therapy and better mental health support more accessible to minoritised local communities in the south-east London area.

I am writing in the hope that you might be interested in supporting our project which needs logo and branding support. We are not particularly proficient with tech and design jargon but we try our best!

We have a range of ideas that we can forward that should help a lot to shape the logo design and the design language that we can use. However there is nothing we are ‘married to’ – we are very open to people’s creativity regarding our design and very grateful for any input offered.

Our project is yet to draw any start-up money or make any income, and the work of developing is only done on a voluntary basis. We are made up of 2 people, one of whom is risking financial hardship. Because of this we are trying where ever possible to keep our costs low via the generosity and support of fellow service cooperatives and social enterprises.

We have tried to raise funds but are now waylaid by a recruitment push due to the loss of one member following bereavements.
