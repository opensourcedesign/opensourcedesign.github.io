[Kedro](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/01_introduction/01_introduction.html) is an open-source Python framework, hosted by the Linux Foundation's LF AI & Data organisation. We're looking for a technical UX designer capable of applying design principles to a technical Python product. 

As a Senior Technical UX Designer at QuantumBlack, you will join our Kedro team, setting industry standards for developing production-ready machine learning code as part of the open source community. Your users will be internal and external analytics professionals who apply machine learning and other analytics techniques at some of the most eminent companies the world over. Some of the experiences you design will be entirely powered by command line interfaces, others might involve advancing Kedro-Viz  together with inspiring visual design colleagues. Your environment will be full of learning opportunities, support, and a healthy dose of fun.
