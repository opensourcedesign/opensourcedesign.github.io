PlugBrain is an open-source digital wellbeing app for Android. It reduces distraction by locking selected apps, users must solve math challenges to unlock them. Difficulty increases the more they use their phone, encouraging healthy habits.

We want a full redesign of the app to make it:
- More modern and visually appealing
- Clearer and easier to navigate
- Engaging and playful without being overwhelming

You will help define the new design direction, including improved onboarding, better flow for locking apps, and redesign challenge screens.

Project is paid, compensation based on experience and agreed scope.
