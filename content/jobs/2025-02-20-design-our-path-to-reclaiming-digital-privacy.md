With the non-profit organization privact e.V. we aim to overcome surveillance capitalism and reclaim digital privacy for all.

We are looking for volunteers to help us create our visual language (CI). This includes everything visual: our logo, website, infographics, merch, trade show booths, and of course the apps we create.

We also welcome less experienced designers. You will work closely with Björn, our project manager and experienced UX mentor.

Interested? Contact us and we will see if there is a match :)
