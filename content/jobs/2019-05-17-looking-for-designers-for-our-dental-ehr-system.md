Looking for any designer willing to help. A lot of the backend design is done but none of the front end design is finalized. 

Things that still need a lot of work on:
- UI/UX design (both low level and high level protoptypes) for all the use cases
- A much better logo

The frontend is mostly QML with a little bit of C++ to interact with the backend. Some knowledge of dentistry is required but I am willing to write the documentation to help with that.

Please note that all design and work is going to be licensed with GPLv3.
