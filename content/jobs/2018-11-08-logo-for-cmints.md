## About CMintS
[CMintS](https://cmints.io) stands for CMS+Internationalization. CMintS Is a
Static Site Generator created with the Internationalization in mind.

## What is the problem?

CMintS currently is using a logo which was just a "draft". Currently CMintS
needs a better logo (ideally branding), to make it more recognizable.
