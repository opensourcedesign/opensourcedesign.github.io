We are creating a new Linux distribution with the purpose of providing a highly optimized Linux distro for ChromeOS devices. It is based on Xubuntu, so we aren't creating a new desktop. See some of hugegreenbug's previous modified distros for examples: https://www.distroshare.com/distros/get/72/. This new distro will support more ChromeOS devices and is a standalone project with multiple team members.

We are in need of a designer to work on the logo, the default desktop look, and the web site design.

We can't offer any money at this time, but we will share donations and any other source of income in the future.
