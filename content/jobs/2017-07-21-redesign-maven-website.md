description: "Apache Maven is the defacto standard build tool for Java development.\r\n\r\nOne of its strong features is being able to generate documentation in several forms based on the code and several markup languages.\r\nMaven is a huge project, but is missing visual creativity and fresh set of eyes on the content. e.g. https://maven.apache.org/index.html is the landing page, but is an overload of information for newbies."
skills: "In the end we must work together to create a new skin (https://maven.apache.org/skins/index.html has current examples). Now a single (sub)project has 1 page layout, often a menu (top or left) and the rest is used for content. I can imagine that general documentation / landing pages get their own template. That's all possible, but must be developed by us.\r\nBe aware that any content somehow fit. The template will have some placeholders with e.g menuitems and the actual content.\r\nSkins are very easy to apply to maven generated websites, so a good skin could conquer the world :)"
