The Radio Witness Project began in 2015 with the goal of making police radio broadcasts more accessible to journalists.
On July 20th the site was made public but we're avoiding media attention for 2 more weeks to allow for some final polishing.
The project really needs some basic branding that can be used for the following:
  + favicon
  + Twitter profile & header photo (twitter.com/radiowitness)
  + Github profile photo (https://github.com/radiowitness)
  + Patreon profile & header photo (patreon.com/radiowitness)

Sorry I cannot offer more funding, we've been self-funded from the start but working on grant applications.
A more thurough branding strategy will be needed as the project grows but for now we just need to get by <3.
