I am @grindhold and recently designed a software that enables people to install many MSI-Installers at once, thus avoiding those endless Next → Next → Next → Finish sessions while not losing configurability of the Packages.

I usually do not write software directly targeted at users. This time I did. And I tried to design an icon which turned out to be an utter abomination.

I am looking for a creative person who would've fun to design an icon that expresses the software. You are not in any way bound to the "moving box"-motif.
