My name is Matthew Vita, a project admin on OpenEMR. I'm looking for design help on mocking up a hospitalized patient management module in OpenEMR. Most clinicians that use the system don't work in a hospital setting, but it's important that we better support those that do, especially in developing countries. This will open doors for healthcare providers that previously couldn't use the system because of such limitations.

About the system:

OpenEMR is the most popular open source electronic health records and medical practice management solution. ONC certified with international usage, OpenEMR's goal is a superior alternative to its proprietary counterparts. With passionate volunteers and contributors dedicated to guarding OpenEMR's status as a free, open source software solution for medical practices with a commitment to openness, kindness and cooperation.

About this gratis job:

- See bullet point 1... https://discourse-uploads-openemr.s3.amazonaws.com/original/2X/9/9baf0034f7b085c9fa146e0782a88015f89e16b9.png - there really isn't a design for such a module. If we could get one, the other programmers and I could start down the right path! This is a big project, but I'm confident that a UX/UI guru could really help lay the landscape.
