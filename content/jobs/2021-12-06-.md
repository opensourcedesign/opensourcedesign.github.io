We are looking for a designer to join our team.

At [Zulip](https://zulip.com/), we’re out to build the world’s best collaboration platform, and we’re committed to keeping it 100% open source. Zulip is the only modern team chat app that is ideal for both live and asynchronous conversations. Our product serves as the communication hub for [businesses](https://zulip.com/for/companies/), [open-source projects](https://chat.zulip.org/case-studies/rust/), [educators](https://chat.zulip.org/case-studies/tum/) and [communities](https://zulip.com/case-studies/lean/) around the world.

We are looking for an experienced product designer with a strong background in visual design to make our web and mobile applications shine. Zulip is a [smart, powerful tool](https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/28/zulip_open_source_chat_collaboration_software/) built for scale. By working to also make Zulip **elegant** and **easy to learn**, you will have the opportunity to have a huge impact on the growth of our product.

**What you’ll do:**

- Develop compelling visual designs for the Zulip web and mobile apps. You will have a leading role in developing the vision for a new look and feel for our product.
- Work closely with the engineering team to integrate your designs.
- Brainstorm, design and implement improvements to the product founded in a deep understanding of user problems, working in a dynamic collaboration with product, engineering, and users.
- Refine the look and feel of the Zulip website, so that our message and brand come across loud and clear.

**Essential qualifications:**

- Your portfolio showcases a track record of designing truly beautiful and functional web and mobile apps. You have been responsible for the overall design of a complex application.
- You are excited to think creatively and develop elegant solutions to complex problems.
- You communicate with clarity and precision, and are comfortable in a distributed work environment. You thrive in an inclusive culture where ideas are debated openly and everyone is treated with respect.
- You will be happy in a startup environment as the only designer on the team.

**We'd especially like to get to know you if:**

- You are comfortable working in CSS to implement your ideas. 
- You are excited to build an open-source product with a community of contributors from around the world. You know how to use Git to collaborate on a software project, or are happy to learn.
