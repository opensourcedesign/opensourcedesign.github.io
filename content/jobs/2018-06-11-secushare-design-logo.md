description: "To say even more than what is introduced on [our website](https://secushare.org), we are designing a platform in which distributed and private interaction between real people is the fundamental principle. We strive for an intuitive and simplistic outcome to a complex engagement of mathematics, sociology, and software.\r\n\r\nWe have gained more and more interest in the last 6 months, as people search for an answer to the problem that is the current state of the Internet, and the platforms therein that we depend on. \r\n\r\nWe are working on a website re-design, and a new logo is desired too. As guiding points, it's probably best to start by reading [the website](https://secushare.org). We would like to avoid \"security\" focused themes such as locks, keys, chains, etc. We view security and privacy as a prerequisite to having real and intimate social interactions, not as the focal point in-and-of itself.\r\n\r\nWe really look forward to reviewing your art, and collaborating!"
