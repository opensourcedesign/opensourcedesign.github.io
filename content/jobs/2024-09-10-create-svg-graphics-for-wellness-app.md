Paul from mentalhealthrevolution.org has has developed the Daily Wellness Empowerment Program (DWEP) course. This has further been developed into an app with the help of a programmer (Tord) https://dwep-app.gitlab.io/

The DWEP app has 10 different practices, and we'd like to have SVG icons/graphics for each of these, possibly with a short animation of the SVG when pressing "done" for the practice

Also we'd like to have SVG files for the states that each practice can be in: Done, Undetermined

(We are also considering creating a new app logo)
