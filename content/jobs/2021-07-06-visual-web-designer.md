- Simply Secure is looking to contract a visual designer who can bring their expertise in web design and crafting brand identities to a new educational website and resource repository launching in August 2021. The website helps lawmakers, advocates, and concerned citizens get the tech policy information they need.

- The website is currently in development, with IA and UX design work underway.

- Several identity guidelines are already in place, including mission, vision, values, and audience. We’re hoping to strike a balance between a tactile, educational feel and a professional and trustworthy polish.

- The design process will be iterative, requiring close collaboration with the project team, including: weekly meetings, asynchronous updates, and willingness to be responsive to team direction and ideas.

About us:

We are a small US 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, founded in 2014 with the goal of making security tools easier to use. We believed – and still do – that security doesn’t have to be confusing to end users. We’ve contributed design to a variety of tools that enhance security, such as Tails to I2P to NoScript. We’ve held salons and a residency around designing for security. But we’ve done a lot more than usable security. Just in the last year, we’ve launched a decentralization pattern library; a report on trust and transparency in nonprofit funding; a campaign to save internet freedom tech; a community around human rights centered design; a series of videos about trust and responsibility in design; and much, much more.

About you: 
- You love and have demonstrated experience designing identity systems. You are really excited to tell the visual story of a tool that helps people.
- You design expressive and accessible screens, logos, and illustrations, meant to be viewed on the web.
- You have experience designing websites.
- You like working independently, in collaboration with a fully remote team.
- You are comfortable advocating for yourself and your work to make sure that you’re getting what you need from us.
- Your meeting availability has sufficient overlap with our working hours of 9am to 5pm Eastern Standard Time. The project team is based on the East Coast of the US.
- You use tools that facilitate easy, remote collaboration (we use Figma, Notion, and Miro, primarily).

Nice to have:
- Awareness of and/or interest in one or more of the following areas: tech criticism and activism, tech policy, human rights, international politics, education.
- Knowledge of web accessibility standards.

Sound like a good fit?
Please send us:

- 3 examples of your work. Please highlight the projects with quick turn-around times (less than 3 months) and tell us, briefly, about the timeline and process: how did these projects get created? Who was involved, what did the process look like, how long did it take?

- A (very short!) outline of how you would approach working with us on this project. What phases would this project have, and what would you need from us to make it successful?

-1-2 references. References will be contacted in the last phase of application review.

- The times you are available for meetings within our working hours (9am to 5pm Eastern Standard Time)

Send these documents to jobs-brand@simplysecure.org.

Position is open until filled and applications will be evaluated on a rolling review. We will stop accepting applications on July 14, 2021.
