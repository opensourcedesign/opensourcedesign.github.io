# Toward Sustainable Open Source Development. Cocoa Developer Wanted.

[Espionage](https://www.espionageapp.com) is a highly rated personal data encryption app for Mac OS X.

It currently follows a ["source code available"](https://www.taoeffect.com/forum/index.php?topic=2699.0) policy, but we think the right thing to do is to completely open source the product.

However, this comes with two significant challenges:

1. If we open source Espionage improperly, there is an extremely significant risk that it will face the same fate as TrueCrypt. More important than open sourcing the app is ensuring its health. A dead, unsupported app is useful to few, whether or not it's open source.
2. We do not have control or ownership of one of the most critical underlying technologies: Apple's encrypted sparsebundles. Therefore, we cannot open source that aspect of Espionage.

### Your Mission, Should You Choose To Accept It

We’re looking for an excellent Cocoa developer who is also interested in solving the problem of funding beneficial, but seemingly unprofitable software, without resorting to advertisements or other nuisances.

Your job will be to work with us to open source the application in a way that is sustainable. This will involve making creative modifications and improvements to the UI, and it will involve novel cryptocurrency concepts.

Initially, we will simply focus on addressing Challenge #1 above. Later on we can move to Challenge #2.

### Requirements

- You have at least 2 years of experience working with Cocoa and Objective-C (or you are a genius who doesn't need 2 years of experience).
- You speak English well.
- You've downloaded and played around with Espionage.
- You have experience designing simple, elegant, and intuitive interfaces with Cocoa.
- Ability to use GPG, or willingness to learn (GPGTools makes it simple).

### Nice to Have

- Interest/experience with infosec related topics.

### We *do not* care about

- Your educational background.
- Your physical location, race, color, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, religious beliefs, age (except as required by law), marital status, disability, or veteran’s status.
