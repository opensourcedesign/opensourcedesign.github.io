Navit is the opensource, vector based navigation software, running on almost any device, from Tomtom to the laster Android phone.
We have over 500.000 installs on Android, but our current interface is probably confusing for new users.

We are looking for someone who could help us review our current design ( ensuring that our icons make sense for example ),
complete what is missing in our current design and review our current menu organization to ensure that it makes sense
for users who have never used our application before.
