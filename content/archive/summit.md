The **Open Source Design Summit** is a community gathering for designers and developers interested in improving design and usability in open source software.

## What is the Summit?

The summit is an unconference-style event where participants:

- Discuss the state of design in open source
- Plan future initiatives and projects
- Work hands-on on design challenges
- Build relationships across the community
- Share knowledge and best practices
