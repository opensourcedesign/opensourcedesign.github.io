Welcome to the Open Source Design brand assets page. Here you'll find our official logos in various formats and variations, ready for use in presentations, articles, events, and other publications.

## Usage Guidelines

- Use the logo with adequate spacing around it
- Don't modify, distort, or recolor the logo
- Use the inverted version on dark backgrounds
- For small sizes, use the icon-only version without text
- When in doubt, use the SVG format for best quality

## Colors

Our primary brand color is **#0F172A** (slate-900), used for the logo and main UI elements.
