Many of the below suggestions are accessible and non-invasive ways of
getting involved in FOSS projects. This doesn't mean you cannot attempt
a large, ambitious project that attempts to 're-design' or change much
of a FOSS project's interface or experience but as first or early
contributions those are often met with concern and caution. The FOSS
project has to know that you will be there through the entire time for a
large contribution project. It's best to start small, actionable,
visibly valuable and understandable for those not familiar with design
terms, processes and practices.

## Improve Labels

### What is this?

Finding better, more concrete labels for buttons, menus and input fields.

### How does it help?

Labels shape expectations -- and these expectations should match what
the software actually will do.

See this issue, changing labels from variable names of the
implementation to common terms:
[inkscape/inkscape!7048](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape/-/merge_requests/7048)
(via [@ltlnx](https://g0v.social/@ltlnx/115883073086406019))

### When and why does it work?

Adjusting labels is often easy, since they are commonly stored
separately from the code and changing the labels usually does not mean
that code needs to be changed. There are two risks when changing labels:

- Existing users are familiar with the old label and that the change
  will be confusing to them
- The new label is longer than the available space, which is
  particularly relevant in languages like German.

## Improve Icons

### What is this?

Finding concrete and familiar icons for buttons, menus and input fields
that match the style of the currently used icons.

### How does it help?

Icons should be familiar to the user and signify the functionality they
stand for. It is important that all icons follow a
common style lest they make the interface look messy.

### When and why does it work?

Like labels, icons are stored separately from code and can be easily
changed. *Risks* of changing icons are:

- Existing users are familiar with the old icon; the change will be
  confusing to them
- Changes are good in theory but introduce unfamiliar elements
- There is no easy to recognize standard icon for what is meant and thus
  a label might be better.

## Layout of existing dialogs

### What is this?

Redesigning layout and widget choice for existing dialogs.

### How does it help?

Choosing widgets that are more familiar and more appropriate to the task
increases usability. A meaningful layout that matches the user's idea
of the system and the user's tasks helps to understand what needs to be
done.

### When and why does it work?

Improving the layout of existing dialogs is actionable, since the
changes focus on the interface itself and thus do not cause ripple
effects through the code but only change one place. This needs basic
knowledge of the available widgets and how they can be laid out.

Risks:

- Suggestions that can not be realized with the available technology
- Not being familiar with the tasks users do might lead to suggestions
  that look visually more clean but do not match the user's needs.

### Examples

- [inkscape/ux#305](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/ux/-/issues/305)
- Interface standards violation, using checkboxes instead of radio
  buttons: [penpot/penpot#8083](https://github.com/penpot/penpot/issues/8083)

*As with any design change or adaption, there are some people that may
prefer aspects of an original design for either very good, evidence-able
reasons or not great, non-evidence based reasons. Iterative and testable
changes/improvements typically work well in FOSS to explore how a user
might use a new layout or interface element which can be used to back up
decisions.*

## Suggesting new features

### What is this?

Suggesting features based on user needs.

### How does it help?

Suggesting features that are based on actual user needs helps to make
applications more useful.

### When and why does it work?

The first question is: Is the feature actually useful?

- A feature from another software that its users like and which you
  tried yourself and found to be helpful, too (relatively easy).
- A feature based on observation and documentation of what you and/or
  other users do (relatively hard)

The other question is: How hard is this to implement? These are factors
that usually lead to difficulties:

- If the feature needs custom UI elements, it is usually harder to
  implement than a feature that can use existing widgets like input
  fields, menus or toolbars
- If the feature relies on complex, hard to define behavior: "If this
  happens, it does... but if that happens...". Anything that "guesses"
  the wanted behavior is often impossible to get right.
- If the feature needs a technology that is not part of the product at
  the moment. This is not easy to find out without knowing at least a
  bit about the code, but if developers mention that it would mean to
  introduce "command-pattern", "real-time evaluation", or "caching", it
  hints that this is possible, but difficult. It might be worth it, but
  it needs a dedicated developer.

### Example: Trash in Penpot

When one deleted a project in Penpot, one would get a warning, but upon
confirmation the project would be gone. This is easy to habitually
dismiss. A well-established mechanism that does not have the problem is
implementing a trash-can, a temporary container from which deleted files
can be retrieved again if one accidentally deleted them or changed one's
mind about them. This feature was suggested by a user in the [penpot community forum](https://community.penpot.app/t/feature-request-add-a-trash-can-for-deleted-files/5746),
jan transferred it to a [github issue](https://github.com/penpot/penpot/issues/4775).
One user commented "I've never needed this feature until today 😭",
implying that they indeed accidentally deleted projects. The feature
request was picked up at some point, so that penpot now has a trashcan
for deleted files.

The feature is relatively simple, since it uses an established metaphor
and mechanism and was probably also not complex to implement, as it
relies on similar components as other ways to organize projects.
