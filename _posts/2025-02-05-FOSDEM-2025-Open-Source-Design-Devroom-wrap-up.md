# FOSDEM 2025 recap - The Open Source Design community is still going strong!

## Introduction

FOSDEM 2025 now marks the eleventh year that Open Source Design have applied for, and been able to run a devroom focused on Open Source, Design and the intersection of these.

The devroom in 2025 ran for a half a day on Sunday from 13.00pm until the end of the conference at 17.00pm. Most talks had a good/full turn out, apart from the one at the end of the day (many folks from overseas head home on Sunday evening!). We had 9 speakers total with 8 talks of 20 minutes each with 5 minutes for questions, though many talks could have been much longer and involved topics and Q&A was full of rich insights, perspective and discussions. All the talks were recorded and will be available on their individual pages on the FOSDEM website. https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/design/ (this website will be archived once FOSDEM 2026’s website is live. When that happens please search for ‘FOSDEM 2025’ in a search engine and look for the archived site)

You can also find every design devroom from 2015 onwards by visiting the yearly specific website of FOSDEM
e.g. https://archive.fosdem.org/2015/schedule/track/open_source_design/ https://archive.fosdem.org/2018/schedule/track/open_source_design/ etc.

One aspect of 2025 that this author is particularly proud of, is that we had a majority (7) people that were femme presenting/women speaking (and two masc presenting/men) speak at the Open Source Design devroom. This is a fantastic ratio in terms of diversity of genders to speak at an OSS conference.

## The Talks

### Design in 5 mins (okay, 20 mins): ecosystem mapping and user research? what is it and how to do it!

## What the audience said...

This year, many folks approached the volunteers at the devroom with comments, thanks and support requests. Here are some of those quotes from people that came to the OSD devroom:

*"I've been coming to FOSDEM for 10 years and the open source design devroom is one of the best rooms"*

*"I'm looking to change from software development to UX design and I didn't think it was possible until after this Dev room"*

*"The open source design devroom is one of the most accessible devrooms in terms of topic. I might not understand design in the same way as designers but I can always understand and appreciate the topics in the room"*

*“I’ve been coming to the open source design devroom for the last 3-4 years and I’m so glad there are other designers doing work in this space and are excited to speak about it”*

If you’d like to send us a review or quote from your experience of the FOSDEM Open Source Design devroom please email us on [core@opensourcedesign.net](mailto:core@opensourcedesign.net) - feedback, compliments and critique is how we keep our volunteer energy up year on year and we always hope to improve experiences of people at FOSDEM as best we can.

You can also email us if you’d like to be involved in the Open Source Design Devroom as a volunteer next year. We always need help with the following:

- Applying for the FOSDEM devroom and stand in September/October every year
- Promoting the call for talks to people in the open source design space
- Helping up develop fundraising processes for travel stipends and raising funds to distribute to speakers and volunteers
