## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Greeting the Open Source Design (OSD) Community

Begin your job post with a friendly greeting to acknowledge the OSD community and set a welcoming tone. You can add this welcome message in the ‘Job Description’ section of the Job Posting form.

**Example:**
> Hello OSD Friends and Collaborators, We're thrilled to introduce new opportunities within our community…

### Step 2: Contact Information

Immediately after your greeting, provide your contact information so interested candidates know how to reach you. It’s useful to offer more than one method of contacting the OSS project such as multiple email addresses or chat services like a Matrix Channel, Discord Server, or Zulip Chats for example (Not every designer contributor will have access to certain chat services so offering an email is always advised.)

**Example:**
> For any questions or to apply, please reach out to us at:
> - Email: [email@example.com]
> - Mobile: [+1234567890] (Optional)
> - GitHub: [github-username]

### Step 3: Role Description

Provide a clear and detailed description of the job role, responsibilities, and the impact this role has on your project.

**Example #1:**
> We're seeking a dedicated UI Designer to revamp our web application's interface, enhancing usability and aesthetics to serve our users better. You'll be collaborating with a team committed to open-source values and innovation.

### Step 4: Requirements and Compensation

List the necessary skills, experience, and any other requirements. Be transparent about the compensation or if you want volunteer contributors.

**Example #1:**
> Required Skills: Proficiency in design software (e.g., Penpot, Adobe XD, Sketch, Figma) - Understanding of user-centered design principles - Experience with collaborative design practices
> Compensation: $50/hour or commensurate with experience - Flexible hours with remote work options

### Step 5: How to Apply

Detail the application process or the preferred contribution process. Include any forms, documents, or portfolio submissions that applicants should prepare as well as any essential documentation reading or onboarding/community calls.

**Example #1:**
> To apply, please submit:
> - Your updated resume or CV
> - A portfolio of relevant design work
> - A brief cover letter explaining why you're a great fit for this role

### Step 6: Closing Statement

Conclude your job post on a high note, reinforcing your enthusiasm for the new potential collaboration and inviting designers to apply.

**Example Closing:**
> We’re excited to see your applications/contributions and look forward to the possibility of you joining our mission in pushing open-source and design forward. Let's innovate together!
