# How to create an article for Open Source Design

Posts on Open Source Design.net appear on the [Articles page here](https://opensourcedesign.net/articles/).

To submit an article using the github interface, here is a step by step guide:

- In the _posts folder, create a 'new file'.

- Give your file a name that starts with the date in this format: 2020-11-01 (year month day) then a title using '-' inbetween words e.g."2015-04-25-welcome-to-open-source-design". Don't forget the .md at the end to indicate that it will be a [mardown file](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

- Make sure you post/article includes essential information at the top of the file e.g. below: 

```layout: post
title: Use your artistic skills to help open source via opensource.com
date: 2020-08-13
categories: design open source 
author: Jeff Macharyas
```

- Check the alignment and formatting of images, text etc. in your article/post. You may need to use span css styles and workarounds to have your article display how you want it to.

- Once finished, you can submit a pull request of your article/post. This will then be reviewed by two open source design community members and comments, changes may be requested before it is published on the [Articles page here](https://opensourcedesign.net/articles/).



If another community member who has posted an article using git commands from their local repo instanace can submit a step by step, that would be great :)
